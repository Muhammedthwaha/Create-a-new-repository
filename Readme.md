Here i am experimenting with Git and Github

i tried different git commands
like:


    1. git init


    2. git remote add origin(url location name, we can choose any name, normally it is origin) <github url>


    3. git branch -M main


    4. git add (*.html:py, or file name, or . -> dot meansentire files) : transfer files to staging area


    5. git commit -m 'Commit message'


    6. git status (To check the status of files, like shere it is added or not, or commited or not, or to sport any modification)
    
    7. git push -u origin main (first time push, origin means url location name, main: branch name)

    8. git push (after first time use only these two words)
